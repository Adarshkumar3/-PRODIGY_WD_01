<p id="description"># Responsive Design: The navigation menu is responsive and collapses into a burger menu on smaller screens using media queries and JavaScript. # Modern CSS Techniques: CSS Grid and Flexbox are used for layout and CSS animations and transitions are applied for engaging effects. # Advanced Functionality: The burger menu toggle is implemented with JavaScript and a parallax scrolling effect is achieved by updating the background's transform property based on the scroll position. # Performance Optimization: CSS animations and transitions are used for smooth interactions and the parallax effect is optimized by updating the transform property directly on scroll events. # Accessibility: Proper focus management and keyboard navigation should be implemented for the burger menu and other interactive elements. ---- This is just a starting point and you can further enhance the functionality design and performance based on your specific requirements.</p>
